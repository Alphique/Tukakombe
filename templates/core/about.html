    <h1>About Tukakombe</h1>

    <p>
        Tukakombe was established to solve a common problem faced by businesses:
        fragmented support across finance, technology, strategy, and branding.
    </p>

    <p>
        Many businesses fail not because of lack of ambition, but because they
        lack access to the right tools, guidance, and capital at the right time.
        Tukakombe exists to change that.
